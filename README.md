# MERN Authentication App
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application with authentication. It allows users to sign up, log in, and log out, and provides access to protected routes only for authenticated users.

## Features
- User authentication: Sign up, log in, and log out functionalities.
- Protected routes: Only authenticated users can access certain routes.
- Full-stack application: Utilizes the MERN stack for both front-end and back-end development.
- React Router: Client-side routing for seamless navigation.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Technologies Used
- Front-end: React.js, React Router
- Back-end: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
